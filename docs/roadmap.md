# Current versions

**v0.1:** [Basic emulation](https://github.com/crempp/js86emu/releases/tag/v0.1)  Apr 22, 2014

Completes SE Code Golf challenge .

**v0.2:** [Extending on basic emulation]() Oct 5, 2014

Extends on the basic emulation and begins to load BIOS.

# Roadmap

The following are the major feature releases planned for js86emu. They are listed in no particular order.

**Complete rewrite towards complete emulation of XT**

Completely rewrite the emulator for node support which will allow for easy testing and debugging. Also a better structure and reuse of code. The goal of this version is complete emulation of an XT system.

Features
1. All instructions and addressing modes
1. IO port support

Tasks/Refactor/Fixes
1. Fix CMP sign extend, it should only happen when
  "If subtrahend is an immediate value it will be sign extended to the length of minuend"
  https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/Control_Flow#Comparison_Instructions
  IDEA: this only happens for EV Ib addressing combos which have a size set to "v" so in Ib check if size is "v", if so sign extend
1. LOTS OF TESTS, catch up on tests
  1. writeMem8 and readMem8 - should be the same
  1. 8086: memory fill
  1. 8086: All instructions exist
  1. 8086: register array access is correct
1. Refactor CPU state as a class
1. Refactor timingCheck
  1. Is there a better way to prevent video sync skips
1. Review what flags each instruction modifies
1. Config files
1. Cleanup external doc folder, put it in drive and share it.

**Deployment**

Support continuous deployment and continuous integration.

Features
1. Integrate with CircleCI for Tests (CI)
1. Integrate with GitLab for CD deployment to DigitalOcean

Tasks/Refactor/Fixes
1. Script to generate fs.json

**Optimizations**

Eventually we'll need to focus on speed. There are many areas ripe for optimization but a quite a bit of micro optimizations are warranted.

Features
1. Ability to run at up to 4.77Mhz both on web and cli

Tasks/Refactor/Fixes
1. figure out a way to conditionally use optimizing flags in node. These don't work on my work laptop
```
  node --max_inlined_source_size=1200 --serialize_eager --max_inlining_levels=12 --max_inlined_nodes=2000 --max_inlined_nodes_absolute=12000 --max_inlined_nodes_cumulative=1000 --max_inlined_nodes_small=100 --min_inlining_frequency=0.6 ./dist/cli/cli.js"
```

**Full CLI**

Extend the command line runner to fuller functionality.

Features
1. Command line runner with parameters to control the functionality of the emulator
1. Full cli debugging - I'm thinking something like GDB.
  1. Memory breakpoints

**Full web**

Extend the web runner to fuller functionality.

Features
* Full web debugging
* Web workers for tasks like graphics rendering

**Electron Native Runner**

Investigate using Electron for running natively
