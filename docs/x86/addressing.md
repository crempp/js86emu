# x86 Addressing

### A
Direct Address. The instruction has no ModR/M byte; the address of the operand is encoded
in the instruction; and no base register, index register, or scaling factor can be
applied (for example, far JMP (EA)).

### C
The reg field of the ModR/M byte selects a control register (for example,
MOV (0F20, 0F22)).

### D
The reg field of the ModR/M byte selects a debug register (for example,
MOV (0F21,0F23)).

### E
A ModR/M byte follows the opcode and specifies the operand. The operand is either a
general-purpose register or a memory address. If it is a memory address, the address is
computed from a segment register and any of the following values: a base register, an
index register, a scaling factor, a displacement.

### F
EFLAGS Register.

### G
The reg field of the ModR/M byte selects a general register (for example, AX (000)).

### I
Immediate data. The operand value is encoded in subsequent bytes of the instruction.

### J
The instruction contains a relative offset to be added to the instruction pointer register
(for example, JMP (0E9), LOOP).

### M
The ModR/M byte may refer only to memory (for example, BOUND, LES, LDS, LSS,
LFS, LGS, CMPXCHG8B).

### O
The instruction has no ModR/M byte; the offset of the operand is coded as a word or
double word (depending on address size attribute) in the instruction. No base register,
index register, or scaling factor can be applied (for example, MOV (A0–A3)).

### P
The reg field of the ModR/M byte selects a packed quadword MMX™ technology register.

### Q
A ModR/M byte follows the opcode and specifies the operand. The operand is either
an MMX™ technology register or a memory address. If it is a memory address, the address
is computed from a segment register and any of the following values: a base register,
an index register, a scaling factor, and a displacement.

### R
The mod field of the ModR/M byte may refer only to a general register (for example,
MOV (0F20-0F24, 0F26)).

### S
The reg field of the ModR/M byte selects a segment register (for example, MOV
(8C,8E)).

### T
The reg field of the ModR/M byte selects a test register (for example, MOV
(0F24,0F26)).

### V
The reg field of the ModR/M byte selects a packed SIMD floating-point register.

### W
An ModR/M byte follows the opcode and specifies the operand. The operand is either
a SIMD floating-point register or a memory address. If it is a memory address, the address
is computed from a segment register and any of the following values: a base register,
an index register, a scaling factor, and a displacement

### X
Memory addressed by the DS:SI register pair (for example, MOVS, CMPS, OUTS, or
LODS).

### Y
Memory addressed by the ES:DI register pair (for example, MOVS, CMPS, INS,
STOS, or SCAS).

## Notes

If segment is not specified, as almost always, it is assumed to be ds, unless
base register is esp or ebp; in this case, the address is assumed to be
relative to ss
